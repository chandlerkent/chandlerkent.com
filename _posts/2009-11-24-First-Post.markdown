I finally got the blog setup again. I am still using Blogger because I don't feel like fussing with installing my own solution. We'll see how far this takes me.

I have a few things I want to write up in the next few days, so stay tuned!

Also, I can't seem to find a good Blogger template, so if anybody has any suggestions, let me know.
